#laptop display mounted to back of MacBook Pro

Every wanted to fit a mac book pro in to a permanent installation, but did not like to keep the lid always a crack open?
By disabling the hinches and glueing the display to the MBP back, it now fits in to tight spaces.
With the remoted power button you will never have to touch the computer again.
